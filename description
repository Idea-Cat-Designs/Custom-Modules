Exit-intent modals allow you to engage and convert more vistors, rapidly grow your blog subscribers, and quickly develop offers without building landing pages. An exit-intent modal is triggered when the user moves their mouse outside the browser window, indicating that they are about to leave your site. By implementing exit-intent modals, companies have seen incredible boosts in their subscriber and engagement metrics. 

This particular modal is highly customizable. Its clean, modern design fits seamlessly with any website, and you can further customize the design with a variety of options: multiple color schemes, custom colors for buttons/outlines, along with various layout choices. You can also customize its behavior: choose how often the modal will appear for the same visitor. Of course, the modal is fully mobile-responsive and optimized for all screen sizes. 

When you purchase this template, the modal will be available in your account for use on any template: Site Page, Landing Page, or Blog.
